This git repo manages changes I (KDP) have made to the iitthesis.cls file.
IIT's font files are supplied for convenience, though I do not expect to edit them.
Bibliography packages (e.g. apacite) are not supplied, since I will not manage them, 
and they are supported by their own authors (e.g. apacite is on CTAN).

Installation: 

After cloning the repo, enter the folder <iithesis/> and run:

	$ sh MakeMyThesis.sh 1
	
This should (fingers crossed) compile the user guide (KDPmods.pdf).
