This git repo manages changes I (KDP) have made to the iitthesis.cls file.
IIT's font files are supplied for convenience, though I do not expect to edit them.
Bibliography packages (e.g. apacite) are not supplied, since I will not manage them, 
and they are supported by their own authors (e.g. apacite is on CTAN).

Wherever you place this git repo directory <iithesis/>,
you will need links to the class and font files in your main compilation directory (MCD)
(i.e. where "YourThesis.tex" lives). I place my <iithesis/> folder directly in my MCD. 
If you do the same, you can run the "makeLinks.sh" script in the MCD to make the required links.
